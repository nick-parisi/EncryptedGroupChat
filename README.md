Android application that is a client for communicating encrypted messages to a chat server. Supportschat groups and custom keys for encrypting and decrypting messages.

The .zip file represents the whole Android project. For convenience, I also committed the source code for the main activity and the XML for the layout.

Note: this will only run on Boston College campus as the chat server is running on a server on the university network.
